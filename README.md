# mulligan-react


Front-end code for a full-stack web application built with React+Redux, NodeJS, Express 4 and MongoDB.
The application was made in the course TDDD27 – Advanced Web Programming, Linköping University.

The application is the perfect tool for golfers who want to keep track of their progress.
They create an account at Mulligan and document their golf rounds to get an overview over their progression and their handicap.
They can connect with other Mulligan users to play golf, and find nearby golf courses based on their location.

The front end is built using the React-framework with Redux.
We use Redux Thunk as middleware, React Router for routing and axios for making HTTP-requests.
Semantic-UI is currently used for its slick components and clean looks.
